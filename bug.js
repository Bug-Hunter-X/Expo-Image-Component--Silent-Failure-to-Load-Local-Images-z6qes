This error occurs when using Expo's `Image` component with a local image URI that is incorrect or inaccessible.  The URI might be misspelled, the image might not exist in the specified location, or the app might not have the necessary permissions to access the image.  The error message might not always be explicit, sometimes just showing a blank space where the image should appear.
